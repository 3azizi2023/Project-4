# Segmenting customers of an e-commerce website

Olist is a Brazilian company that offers a solution for selling on online marketplaces.

We need to provide its e-commerce teams with customer segmentation that they can use on a daily basis for their communication campaigns.

Objective

Understand different types of users based on their behavior and personal data.

Provide the marketing team with an actionable description of the segmentation and its underlying logic for optimal use, along with a proposed maintenance contract based on an analysis of the stability of segments over time.

Data

For this mission, Olist provides an anonymized database containing information on order history, purchased products, satisfaction comments, and customer locations since January 2017.

Mission

Assist Olist's teams in understanding different types of users (using unsupervised methods) to group customers with similar profiles. These categories can be used by the Marketing team for more effective communication.

We will create four documents to prepare a response to Olist:

An exploratory analysis notebook.
A notebook with trials of different modeling approaches.
A simulation notebook to determine the necessary update frequency of the segmentation model to ensure its relevance.
A presentation for a colleague to gather feedback on your approach.
